# Context

A couple days ago a friend of mine shared this map of europe and naturally came the question: How many dinners could we attend in one day ? It looked like an easy enough graph problem that is certainly NP-hard, so I decided to dive into the problem.

# Problem's statement

Let say we have a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $N$ vertices. Each vertice $v \in V$ represents a country and holds a tuple $(T_v^B, T_v^E) \in R_+$ the times at which the dinner begins and ends. The edges of our graph hold the travel time between two places, we denote for $u,v \in V, D(u,v) \in R_+ \cup \set{+\infty}$ the distance/travel time between $u$ and $v$.

The decision problem we are looking at is stated as follow: 
For $M$ a natural numbler, is there a simple path $ (v_1 \cdots v_K)$ such that:

- $$ \forall i \in [1, K-1], \, T_{v_i}^E + D(v_i, v_{i+1}) \leq T_{v_{i+1}}^D $$ 
  _ie._ we arrive  on time at the next dinner while having left at the end of the last one)
- K $\geq$ M

If a route does not exist it is encoded by a distance $D(u,v) = +\infty$. 

# NP-completeness

## Problem in NP

It is easy to show that this decision problem is actually in NP. Indeed, for a given path $ (v_1 \cdots v_K) $ and $M$, we can check both conditions in linear time with respect to the size of the solution. 

## NP-hardness

Now the hard part. We want to show that this problem is actually as hard as any other problem in NP. To do so we will build a reduction from the [Longest Path Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem) which is known to be itself NP-complete (hence NP-hard). This problem is about finding the longest simple path in a given graph, you can already see how it can relate to the problem at our hands! The associated decision problem is obviously to decide wether there exists a simple path of lenght greater than $M$.

Let say we have an instance $I$ of the Longest Path Problem, we have a graph $G = (V, E)$, with $N$ vertices and $M$. Let's build $I'$ an instance of the Max-Dinners problem. 
- We keep the same vertices, so we build $V' = V$, and for each $v \in V'$ we set $T_v^B = T_v^E = 1$, all the dinners happen instantaneously at the very same time. 
- We keep the same edges so $E' = E$ and for all $(u,v) \in V'^2$ we set $D(u,v) = 0$ if $(u,v) \in E'$ and $+\infty$ otherwise. If the edge existed in the initial graph we can travel instantaneously through it (so we don't miss dinner !).
- And we take M' = M

Therefore we have $I' = (G'=(V', E'), M')$.

This process describes how to build an instance of Max-dinners from a generic instance of Longest path and the built instance has a linear size with respect to the size of the initial problem. Now we have to show that $I$ has a solution if and only if $I'$ has a solution.

Let's assume that we have $(v_1 \cdots v_K)$ a solution of $I$. We then have $K \geq M$ and we can note that it's a simple path.
Moreover, we know that $\forall i, (v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E$, therefore by construction we have $\forall i, D(v_i, v_{i+1}) = 0$ and $T_{v_i}^B = T_{v_i}^E = 1 = T_{v_{i+1}}^B = T_{v_{i+1}}$. It is then easy to check that  

- $ \forall i \in [1, K-1], \, T_{v_i}^E + D(v_i, v_{i+1}) \leq T_{v_{i+1}}^D $
- K $\geq M = M'$

We can conclude that $(v_1 \cdots v_K)$ is a solution of $I'$.

Conversely, we assume that $(v_1 \cdots v_K)$ is a solution of $I'$. Since $G$ and $G'$ shares vertices and edges, $v_1 \cdots v_K$ is a simple path in $G$ too, of length $K \geq M' = M$. Therefore it's a solution of $I$.

We can conclude that Max-dinners is at least as hard as Longest path (it's essentially the same problem as you just saw) and since it's in NP, it's NP-complete.

# Solution (for those who came here wanting the answer to the question)

In a first version of this article I did not bother to include a solution to the actual problem. After complaints of some friends who don't give a shit about maths and just want to know which planes to book I wrote down the algorithm and got the solution. [The whole code is available on my github](https://github.com/icannos/blog-projects/tree/master/maxdinners).
It turned out that even with the [concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde) we can only attend 4 dinners in one day in Europe.

First I had to build the data:

And the bruteforce algorithm which comes along:

```python
def d(t1, t2):
    return datetime.timedelta(
        hours=distance.distance((t1[3], t1[4]), (t2[3], t2[4])).km / speed
    )

def maxdinners(current_path, left):
    bpath = []
    path = []

    for i in left:
        if len(current_path) == 0:
            current_path.append(i)
            path = maxdinners(current_path, left - {i})
            current_path.pop()
        else:
            if tuples[i][1] >= tuples[current_path[-1]][2] + d(
                tuples[i], tuples[current_path[-1]]
            ):
                current_path.append(i)
                path = maxdinners(current_path, left - {i})
                current_path.pop()

        if len(path) > len(bpath):
            bpath = path

    return bpath if len(bpath) > len(current_path) else [i for i in current_path]

```
