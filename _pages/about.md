I am currently a PhD candidate in information theory and machine learning applied to NLP under the supervision of Pablo Piantanida and Jackie CK Cheung. I am pursuing a joint PhD programm between the ILLS, Paris-Saclay University and MILA, McGill University. I previously completed a Master's degree in applied mathematics for machine learning from Sorbonne Université and a Master's degree in fundamental computer science from ENS de Lyon.

I am also interested in the broader impact and deployement of AI models in society. I have got both a master's degree in philosophy of science from Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne (La Sorbonne) and an engineering degree with a specialization in Public Affairs and innovation from Les Mines Paris. My thesis deals with the notion of robustness of learnt model and its impact on AI regulation.
